## To complete **Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation**:

### **Step 1.1: Data Cleaning**
   - **Objective**: Ensure data consistency and readability.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate recipes.
     - **Normalize Text**: Standardize ingredient names (e.g., “bell pepper” vs. “capsicum”) and steps.
     - **Spell-Check and Correct Typos**: Use NLP tools like `nltk` to identify and correct common misspellings.
     - **Standardize Units**: Convert measurements to a consistent format (e.g., grams, tablespoons) using libraries like `quantulum3`.

### **Step 1.2: Tokenize Ingredients and Steps**
   - **Objective**: Break down ingredients and steps into tokens (individual elements).
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **Ingredients Tokenization**:
       - Split ingredients into base ingredients, quantities, and units.
       - Use NLP tools or regular expressions to parse phrases (e.g., "1 cup chopped onions" to `ingredient="onions"`, `quantity=1`, `unit="cup"`).
     - **Steps Tokenization**:
       - Segment steps into individual actions or verbs (e.g., “chop,” “saute,” “bake”) and the related ingredient(s).
       - Generate a list of common cooking actions and tag each step with relevant actions.

### **Step 1.3: Assign States to Ingredients and Steps**
   - **Objective**: Define the unique states required for Markov Chain modeling.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **Ingredient States**: Assign each unique ingredient a state ID.
     - **Step States**: Assign each unique cooking action a state ID.
     - Create mappings to link each ingredient or step to a state, forming the basis for building the transition matrix.

### **Step 1.4: Annotate Data with Cuisines and Dietary Tags**
   - **Objective**: Tag each recipe with cuisine and dietary information for better personalization.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Automated Tagging**: Use text analysis to tag recipes based on keywords (e.g., “spaghetti” for Italian cuisine).
     - **Manual Verification**: Verify a sample of tagged recipes to ensure accuracy and adjust automated tagging rules if needed.

---

### **Step 1.5: Structure Data in a DataFrame**
**DataFrame Structure**: Use a `pandas` DataFrame for in-memory data handling, with columns such as `recipe_id`, `ingredient`, `quantity`, `unit`, `step`, `cuisine`, `nutrition`, and `tags`.

---
   - **Objective**: Ensure data quality and save the final dataset for modeling.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **Data Quality Checks**: Run checks for missing values, outliers, and consistency (e.g., all units converted to a standard format).
     - **Save Data**: Export cleaned and structured data to a `.csv` file or database for easy retrieval in modeling steps.
     - **Document Data**: Document the data structure and any processing assumptions for future reference.
