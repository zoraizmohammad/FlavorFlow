### **2.1: Define States** -- RM
   - **Objective**: Identify and enumerate all unique states in the dataset, which include ingredients and cooking steps.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.1.1: Extract Unique Ingredients**:
       - Use your preprocessed data to compile a list of all unique ingredients.
       - Assign each ingredient a unique state ID (e.g., `Ingredient_1`, `Ingredient_2`, etc.).
     - **2.1.2: Extract Unique Cooking Steps**:
       - Compile a list of all unique cooking steps or actions (e.g., “chop,” “saute,” “bake”).
       - Assign each step a unique state ID (e.g., `Step_1`, `Step_2`, etc.).
     - **2.1.3: Create a State Mapping**:
       - Map each ingredient and step to its corresponding state ID, creating a dictionary or lookup table for easy reference during transition tracking.

### **2.2: Track Transitions Between States**
   - **Objective**: Analyze the order of ingredients and steps in each recipe to identify transitions between states.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.2.1: Loop Through Recipes**:
       - Iterate through each recipe in the dataset.
       - For each recipe, extract the sequence of ingredients and steps.
     - **2.2.2: Record State Transitions**:
       - For each consecutive pair of ingredients or steps, record the transition from one state to the next.
       - Example: If a recipe calls for “chop onions” followed by “saute onions,” record a transition from `Step_Chop` to `Step_Saute`.
     - **2.2.3: Build a Transition Frequency Table**:
       - Use a dictionary or matrix to keep track of how many times each transition occurs.
       - The table should capture the frequency of each transition from state \(i\) to state \(j\).

### **2.3: Calculate Transition Probabilities**
   - **Objective**: Convert the transition frequencies into probabilities for the Markov Chain.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.3.1: Initialize a Transition Matrix**:
       - Create an \(N \times N\) matrix, where \(N\) is the total number of states (ingredients + steps).
       - Initialize all elements of the matrix to zero.
     - **2.3.2: Populate the Matrix with Frequencies**:
       - Fill each element \(P(i, j)\) of the matrix with the recorded frequency of transitions from state \(i\) to state \(j\).
     - **2.3.3: Normalize to Get Probabilities**:
       - For each state \(i\), calculate the total number of transitions from \(i\).
       - Divide each frequency \(P(i, j)\) by the total number of transitions from \(i\) to convert it into a probability:
         \[
         P(i, j) = \frac{\text{Frequency of transitions from } i \text{ to } j}{\text{Total transitions from } i}
         \]
     - **2.3.4: Handle Special Cases**:
       - **No Outgoing Transitions**: If a state \(i\) has no outgoing transitions, you may need to define a default behavior, such as looping back to the start or ending the sequence.
       - **Self-Transitions**: Ensure the model accounts for states that may transition back to themselves (e.g., repeated actions like stirring).

---

### **2.4: Validate the Transition Matrix**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the transition matrix is correctly constructed and sums to 1 for each row.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.4.1: Check Row Sums**:
       - Verify that each row of the transition matrix sums to 1 (within a small tolerance for floating-point precision).
     - **2.4.2: Adjust for Rounding Errors**:
       - If any row does not sum to 1 due to rounding errors, adjust the probabilities slightly to ensure they add up correctly.
     - **2.4.3: Inspect for Anomalies**:
       - Look for any unexpected patterns or outliers in the transition matrix that could indicate errors in data collection or processing.

---

### **2.5: Save the Transition Matrix**
   - **Objective**: Store the transition matrix for use in the recipe generation process.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.5.1: Save as a CSV or Matrix File**:
       - Export the matrix to a `.csv` file or save it in a suitable format (e.g., a binary file using libraries like `numpy`).
     - **2.5.2: Document the Matrix**:
       - Record the structure of the matrix and any assumptions made during construction (e.g., handling of states with no outgoing transitions).
     - **2.5.3: Version Control**:
       - Use version control (e.g., Git) to keep track of changes in the transition matrix as you iterate on your model.

---

### **2.6: Prepare for Further Use**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the matrix is ready for integration into the Markov Chain model for recipe generation.
   - **Sub-Steps**:
     - **2.6.1: Test Matrix with Simple Simulations**:
       - Run simple simulations to check that the matrix behaves as expected and produces plausible transitions.
     - **2.6.2: Optimize Matrix Storage**:
       - If the matrix is sparse (many zero entries), consider using sparse matrix representations to save memory and improve performance.
     - **2.6.3: Integrate into the Next Steps**:
       - Make sure the matrix is easily accessible for the subsequent recipe generation process.

By carefully following these sub-steps, you will have a robust and well-validated transition matrix that forms the core of your Markov Chain model for generating personalized recipes.
