## **Markov chains Q&A:**

### 1. **What is a Markov Chain?**
   A Markov Chain is a sequence of events (or states) where the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state, not on any previous states. This property is known as the **Markov Property**.

### 2. **What is the Markov Property?**
   The Markov Property states that the future state depends only on the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. Mathematically, if \(P(X_{t+1} = s | X_t = s_t, X_{t-1} = s_{t-1}, ..., X_0 = s_0) = P(X_{t+1} = s | X_t = s_t)\), then the process satisfies the Markov Property.

### 3. **What is a Transition Matrix in Markov Chains?**
   A Transition Matrix, often denoted by \(P\), is a square matrix where each entry \(P{ij}\) represents the probability of transitioning from state \(i\) to state \(j\) in a single step. Each row sums to 1, representing the probabilities of all possible next states from a given current state.

### 4. **How are Multi-step Transition Probabilities Calculated?**
   Multi-step transition probabilities are obtained by raising the transition matrix \(P\) to the power corresponding to the number of steps. For example, the probability of transitioning from state \(i\) to state \(j\) in \(t\) steps is given by the \((i, j)\)-entry of the matrix \(P^t\).

### 5. **What is the State Space of a Markov Chain?**
   The state space \(S\) of a Markov Chain is the set of all possible states that the chain can be in. For instance, if a chain has 3 states, then \(S = \{1, 2, 3\}\).

### 6. **What are Communicating Classes?**
   Communicating classes are groups of states within a Markov Chain where each state can be reached from any other state within the same class. A class is **closed** if no transitions can move the chain out of the class.

### 7. **How is the Probability Distribution of a State \(X_t\) Calculated?**
   The probability distribution of the state \(X_t\) is calculated using the initial distribution vector \(\pi\) and the transition matrix \(P\). The distribution of \(X_t\) is given by the vector \(\pi P^t\), where \(t\) is the number of steps.

### 8. **What are Hitting Probabilities?**
   Hitting probabilities measure the probability that a Markov Chain will eventually reach a specific set of states starting from a particular state. This can be represented in vector form, where each entry corresponds to the probability of hitting the target set from each initial state.

### 9. **What is an Absorbing State?**
   An absorbing state is a state that, once entered, cannot be exited. In a Markov Chain, this is represented by a row in the transition matrix with a 1 on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere.

### 10. **How is the Expected Hitting Time Calculated?**
   The expected hitting time from a state \(i\) to a set of states \(A\) is the expected number of steps needed to reach \(A\) starting from \(i\). This can be determined using first-step analysis and a system of equations based on transition probabilities.

These questions cover key concepts in Markov Chains and provide insights into their structure and analysis. Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these points.
