### **Project: Personalized Recipe Generator Using Markov Chains**

#### **Project Overview:**

This project aims to create a **personalized recipe generator** that uses **Markov Chains** to predict and suggest the next ingredient or cooking step based on prior selections, user preferences, and historical recipe data. By analyzing a dataset of recipes and user interactions, the Markov Chain can model transitions between ingredients or steps, generating new and creative recipes tailored to individual preferences.

The model can be extended to take into account **ingredient availability**, **user dietary restrictions**, and **cuisine preferences**, making it highly customizable. The system could be designed as a web or mobile app where users input an initial ingredient or cooking step, and the generator predicts what the next step or ingredient should be based on the Markov Chain.

### **Project Structure:**

#### **1. Data Collection & Preparation:**

- **Data Sources**: Collect a dataset of recipes from [RecipeNLG](https://github.com/Glorf/recipenlg)

- **Data Points**: Each recipe should include:

  - List of ingredients

  - Cooking steps

  - Cuisine type

  - Dietary restrictions (if available)

  - Serving size and nutritional information

- **Data Preprocessing**:

  - Tokenize recipes into individual steps and ingredients.

  - Remove duplicates and clean the data to ensure consistency.

  - Assign each ingredient/cooking step a state for the Markov Chain.


#### **2. Markov Chain Construction:**

- **Markov Chain Setup**:

  - **States**: Each ingredient and cooking step will be a state in the chain.

  - **Transitions**: For each recipe, you track the order of ingredients or steps as transitions from one state to another.

  - **Transition Matrix**: Create a **transition matrix** where each element P(i,j) represents the probability of transitioning from state i (current ingredient or step) to state j (next ingredient or step).

- **Formulation**:

  - Transition probabilities are calculated by counting the number of times an ingredient or step follows another in the dataset.

  - **P(i,j)=Number of times state j follows state i / Total occurrences of state i​**


#### **3. Personalization Logic:**

- **Incorporating User Preferences**:

  - Users can provide their preferences (e.g., vegetarian, low-carb, favorite cuisines).

  - Filter the Markov Chain’s state space to only include transitions that match these preferences.

  - Use **personalized transition matrices** where probabilities are adjusted based on user history (e.g., higher probabilities for ingredients or cuisines the user frequently selects).

- **Ingredient Availability**:

  - Adjust the Markov Chain based on ingredients the user has at home. This can be done by modifying the transition probabilities so that unavailable ingredients have a transition probability of zero.


#### **4. Recipe Generation:**

- Start with a randomly selected ingredient or step, depending on user input.

- Use the Markov Chain to predict the next ingredient or step by selecting the state with the highest transition probability.

- Continue generating until the recipe meets predefined criteria (e.g., recipe length, number of servings, nutritional targets).


#### **5. Statistical Analysis and Extensions:**

- **Transition Probability Estimation**:

  - Analyze the transition matrix for key insights:

    - **Frequent Ingredient Pairings**: Identify the most common transitions between ingredients across different cuisines or recipe categories.

    - **Rare Transitions**: Highlight unusual ingredient combinations that could suggest creative or experimental recipes.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

  - Visualize the distribution of transitions (e.g., heatmaps of the transition matrix).

  - Perform **cluster analysis** on ingredients or steps to group similar cooking methods or ingredient combinations.

- **Conditional Probability Analysis (CPA)**:

  - Use **conditional probabilities** to personalize the recipe flow:

    - P(next ingredient∣previous ingredient): Adjust the flow based on user preferences or specific recipes.

- **Markov Chain Statistics**:

  - **Stationary Distribution**: Compute the stationary distribution to see which ingredients or steps are most likely to appear in generated recipes as the Markov process runs infinitely.

  - **Absorbing States**: Identify if any ingredients or steps serve as absorbing states (i.e., points at which the recipe terminates, such as final garnishing or plating).

  - **Expected Recipe Length**: Use Markov Chain properties to estimate the expected number of steps or ingredients in a recipe based on user preferences or cooking methods.


#### **6. Statistics and Analytics:**

- **Nutritional Balance Analysis**:

  - After generating a recipe, perform a nutritional analysis to ensure it meets user-defined goals (e.g., balanced macronutrient profile, low sodium).

  - Use **regression analysis** to model the relationship between the generated ingredients and their nutritional content (e.g., using linear regression to predict calorie count based on ingredient weights).

- **Recipe Complexity Estimation**:

  - Use statistics to estimate the complexity of the generated recipe by calculating the average number of transitions between complex steps (e.g., sous vide vs. simple boiling).

  - A complexity score can be derived based on transition entropy, where higher entropy indicates more complex recipes with diverse transitions.

- **Culinary Trend Analysis**:

  - Track how frequently certain ingredients appear in generated recipes over time. This can be done using **time series analysis** to observe trends in ingredient popularity.

  - For example, analyze the transition matrix for seasonal changes (e.g., pumpkin becoming more common in fall).


#### **7. Model Evaluation:**

- **Accuracy and User Feedback**:

  - Evaluate the system by collecting user feedback on generated recipes. Use metrics like **recipe satisfaction** (e.g., ratings, reviews) and adjust transition probabilities accordingly.

  - Perform **cross-validation** on Markov model by splitting the dataset into training and test sets and measuring the accuracy of predicted ingredients compared to real recipes.

- **Statistical Testing**:

  - Perform **Chi-square tests** or **log-likelihood ratio tests** to compare different transition matrices (e.g., transition matrix for Italian cuisine vs. Indian cuisine) to determine if the differences in ingredient flow are statistically significant.

**8. Platform Development**

### **Potential Extensions:**

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Enhance the model by incorporating reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust transition probabilities based on user feedback or preferences.

- **Contextual Markov Chains**: Introduce contextual elements into the Markov Chain, such as adjusting the transition probabilities based on time of day (e.g., suggesting breakfast-like recipes in the morning).

- **Hybrid Models**: Combine the Markov Chain with other models, such as a neural network, to improve the recipe generation by learning deeper, non-linear patterns in ingredient combinations.

### **Tech Stack:**

- **Python Libraries**:

  - `numpy` & `pandas` for data manipulation and matrix operations.

  - `markovify` for simple Markov Chain modeling.

  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization (e.g., visualizing transition matrices and trends).

  - `scikit-learn` for exploratory data analysis, regression, and clustering.

  - Optional: `Flask` or `Django` for building the web interface.
